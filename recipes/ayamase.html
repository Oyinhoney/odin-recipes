    <h3>
        How To Prepare Ayamase Sauce.
    </h3>

    <p>
        Ayamase sauce, also known as Ofada stew or Designer stew, originated in Ikenne-Remo, Ogun State, Nigeria. The sauce is a creation of Mrs. Felicia Ajibabi Adesina, who began selling her stew in the town in the 1920s.
        The name Ayamase is said to come from the name of Mrs. Adesina's husband, Mase, and the Yoruba word "aya" which means "wife".
        Mrs. Adesina started selling her stew by walking around town, but eventually set up a stall in front of her home.
        Ayamase is a spicy sauce made with unripe habaneros, locust beans, onions, eggs, and vegetable oil.
        It's traditionally served with Ofada rice, a locally grown Nigerian rice with a unique aroma and slightly sticky texture. 
        Ayamase is also known as Obe Aya Mase, Obe-iresi, and Obe dudu.
